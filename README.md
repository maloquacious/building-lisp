# Building LISP in GO

Building LISP in GO is a fork of Leo's "[Building LISP](https://www.lwh.jp/lisp/index.html)".

I've changed the directory structure for my convenience.
Chapters are now in separate folders along with their code.
This allows me to test changes, keep code and text in sync, and see how the code changes between chapters.

Naturally, all mistakes are mine.
